Since I've been reading "Musashi's Dokkodo: The Way of Walking Alone" by Lawrence Kane and Kris Wilder I thought I would collect some notes on it.

## 3 - Do not, under any circumstances, depend on a partial feeling

"Trust, but verify" is the military slogan but "don't trust, verify" is better when possible. Consider all the facts (or all that are available at the time) and don't act based on feeling alone, especially knee jerk reactions.

## 4 - Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world

Minimise your ego, don't take yourself too seriously. Focus on training/improving the mind and not just the body. Think how you/your business can make money in a sustainable/ethical/environmentally friendy manner. Consider the world (humanity) and your part in it.

## 5 = Be detached from desire your whole life

Pretty much everyone disagreed with Musashi on this one, which makes sense as he was a buddhist and this seems to be related to that philosophy. My naive interpretation of his quote is that we seek to detach ourselves from desire but, this is an ideal to strive for, not neccesarily something that we can reach (or should reach). Remove the wants and leave the needs. Though in these modern times it's probably fine to have some wants and to satisfy them ;)
Living in a utilitarian fashion (or close to it) and with a low time preference is a sure way to increase your wealth and perhaps your appreciation for what you do have, instead of what you don't.


## 6 - Do not regret what you have done


## 7 - Never be jealous
