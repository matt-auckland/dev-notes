### Website about NavCoin static rewards

Has a staking reward calculator, compares your stakes over a period (months, years).
Explains what static rewards are and what the benefits of them are for the network

## Other

### Alexandria

Library App. Electron app that tracks your books. Similar to MAL or Anilist.
Could be made into a website eventually? For personal use an electron app works best though.

### Kata break-down

Instead of breaking a kata down into photos, breaks it down into a series of gifs/short clips.
Loops on each step of the kata so people can see how each move should look. Also would have full playback of a kata. Allow for slow mo and reverse playback as well. Show notes for each clip.
